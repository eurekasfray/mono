# Introduction

I have designed a convention to standardize a workflow for when I practice animation. This is Mono. It offers a pipeline that caters to the stages of animation production. I consider the stages of development, preproduction, shotproduction, preproduction, and distribution.

<!-- Feels like the paragraph above needs more here. -->

This is a living document. It is updated when I need to make improvements to it. My intention is for Mono to evolve into something useful.

## Goal

* Develop standardized rules and conventions to guide production of an animation exercise or very short animated film.

## What is Mono?

Mono is a workflow that sets rules and conventions to guide me along when I'm studying, practicing, and making animation. The workflow features a production-like pipeline.

## Background

I made Mono because I had found that inconsistencies arose between each of my productions as I animated more and more. Production assets had varying -- and often changing -- names and hierarchical organizations. What was one thing during my last exercise was a another during the next exercise. I soon identified the issue at hand to be the result of an unestablished production pipeline. I needed a consistent workflow. And that was how I conceived Mono.


# Design

## Pipeline

A production pipeline according to Urchin

> can be considered to be an amalgam of
> * Production Software; i.e. what you use to make stuff, which spills into file formats and capabilities, can also include automation / project specific software that depends on project practices.
> * Standards and Best practices: naming conventions, project file organization, dos and donâ€™ts, limits on poly count, image size, etc.
> * Pipeline software: any software or scripts that automate the pipline, project on a metalevel, or enforce the best practices, or better, allow only those best practices to be used (i.e. instead of using append/link, use the project approved asset manager, which only links in predictable ways)

## Principles

The file-organization conventions follows some principles that allow it to be useful.

<!--
TODO:
Make each principle in the following format: Principle {n}. {Title}. {Paragraph about with about 160 characters}.
-->

* Principle 1. Originals and derivatives. Separate derived files from their originals. By keeping the original files in one place we can link derived files back to the originals. This applies to linking project files to source files.

* Principle 2. Organization describes how files are grouped according to content, usage or value.

* Principle 3. -- Storage is how you handle the files: What's in a folder? What folder names you use? How you design the folder hierarchy.

* Principle 4. Flexibility. Offer enough of a framework for flexibility.

* Principle 5. DRY. Don't repeat yourself. This applies to directory names. Do not use file organization that requires for you to have two or layouts that repeat each other.

                location, we can reference background across different shots.
