# Introduction

I have designed a workflow for when practicing animation. This is Mono. Mono sets rules and conventions to guide me along when I'm studying, practicing, and making animation. The workflow features a production-like pipeline which caters to the different stages of animation production &mdash; development, preproduction, shotproduction, preproduction, and distribution.

I made Mono for various reasons. First, devising a method for storing the files weighed heavily on me each time I performed an exercise. Second, inconsistencies arose between each exercise more and more. Production assets had varying &mdash; and often changing &mdash; names and hierarchical organizations. What was one thing during my last exercise was a another during the next exercise. I needed a consistent way to work. What I needed was a workflow. I needed a pipeline.

[//]: # (Feels like the paragraph above needs more)

This is a living document. It is updated when I need to make improvements to it. My intention is for Mono to evolve into something useful.

## Goal

* Develop standardized rules and conventions to guide production of an animation exercise or very short animated film.


# Design

## Pipeline

A production pipeline according to Urchin "can be considered to be an amalgam of"
> * Production Software; i.e. what you use to make stuff, which spills into file formats and capabilities, can also include automation / project specific software that depends on project practices.
> * Standards and Best practices: naming conventions, project file organization, dos and donâ€™ts, limits on poly count, image size, etc.
> * Pipeline software: any software or scripts that automate the pipline, project on a metalevel, or enforce the best practices, or better, allow only those best practices to be used (i.e. instead of using append/link, use the project approved asset manager, which only links in predictable ways)

## Principles

The file-organization conventions follows some principles that allow it to be useful.

[//]: # (Note:)
[//]: # (* Each principle must be written in the following format: Principle {n}. {Title}. {Paragraph about 185-200 characters long}.)

* **Principle 1** - Originals and derivatives. Separate derived files from their originals. By keeping the original files in one place we can link derived files back to the originals. This means we can link source files to project files.

* **Principle 2** - Storage. How do you handle the files: What's in a folder? What folder names you use? How you design the folder hierarchy.

* **Principle 3** - Organization. This describes how files are grouped according to content, usage or value.

* **Principle 4** - Flexibility. Offer enough of a framework for flexibility.

* **Principle 5** - DRY (Don't repeat yourself). This applies to directory names. Do not use file organization that requires for you to have two or layouts that repeat each other.

`shot` is short for 'shotproduction'. This folder has the following conventions:

<!-- Let each paragraph have a consistent number of characters like say 400 -->

* **`bg`** (*folder*): This folder stores background art. Background art lives at the same heirarchical level as the *sequence*, *scene*, and *shot* folders. This makes us happy, because a single background art can be used in multiple shots. That means, background files can be referenced to since they remain in a fixed location. Different shots can reference a single background, as opposed to having the same background file copied to different shot folders.

* **`bg\bg01_starshipLobbyStairWide.psd`** (*project file*): This is the project file for a background. Its filename goes like this: *bg[n]_[name].[projectExt]*. *n* is a numerical identifier for the background art. Totally up to you. This number help us identity and make unique each background. *name* is a name for the background.
* **`bg\bg01_starshipLobbyStairWide.png`** (*exported file*): An exported background image. This file's name must be the same as the file from which it was exported. Its filename is written like this: *bg[n]_[name].[exportExt]*.

A film can be broken down into sequences, scenes, and shots. A film is a series of sequences. Each sequence is made of up of a series of scenes, which is composed of a series of shots. I've broken down each part into an orginization of folders.

* **`sq01_chase`** (*folder*): A sequence; stores scenes that help make it up. A sequence has an number and can be given a name, and is written like this: *sq[n]_[name]*.
* **`sq01_chase\sc01`** (*folder*): A scene. Each scene is numbered. Each scene folder is written like this: *sc[n]*.
* **`sq01_chase\sc01\sc01_dopesheet.psd`** (*project file*): The dope or exposure sheet. The dope sheet is named like this: *sc[n]_dopesheet.[projectExt]*. It keeps the scene number as *n*.
* **`sq01_chase\sc01\sc01_sh01`** (*folder*): This is a shot folder. A shot folder takes the scene number and gets a shot number. We name a shot folder like this: *sc[n]_sh[n]*.
* **`sq01_chase\sc01\sc01_sh01\`sc01_sh01.tvpaint`** (*project file*): A shot animation project file. Animation work is done in this project file. It takes the scene number and the shot number. We name this file like this: *sc[n]_sh[n].[projectExt]*.
